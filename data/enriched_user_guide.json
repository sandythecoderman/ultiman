    "original_chunk": "Asset Types There are multiple types of assets in an organization. The first step of asset management is the categorization of assets. Broader categorization enables better management. The default categorization of assets within Infraon is as follows: Asset Type -> Asset Category -> Asset Sub-Category -> Asset The process of managing an asset is based on the type of asset. Infraon asset has been split into four modules based on asset type. IT Assets are physical assets or devices used in an organization's business activities that fall under the responsibility of IT staff. For example, computers, servers, routers, scanners, fax machines, printers, modems, hubs, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Fixed Assets are any physical objects or vehicles you consider 'assets' to your organization. It can be easily converted into cash\u2014for example, vehicles, machinery, equipment, etc. Consumables are assets that organizations use. They must be replaced regularly because they wear out or are used up\u2014for example, mouse devices, external keyboards, computer cables, printer toners, etc. Software Assets are any functional software in an organization that requires service level agreement to ensure compliance with software licenses. For example, software assets may be internal or external, on-premises, or in the cloud. Within these asset Types, assets are further classified into: Categories \u2013 Categories are also referred to as 'parent' categories. A category is the first division of assets within the selected asset type. For example, within IT assets, there can be categories like laptops, desktops, etc. Sub-Categories - Sub-categories are also referred to as child categories. The sub-category is the next level of asset division within the category. For example, if the categories are laptop or desktop, sub-categories within IT assets can be Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc. Assets or asset items can be added here. Refer to the 'Asset Grid Page' and 'Asset Categories' sections for details and instructions. Note: Assets can be added in the category and the sub-category level. The steps to view, add, edit, and manage assets are the same regardless of the asset type. Steps to Look for a Specific Asset",

This encompasses provisioning compute nodes, client devices, applications, and network fabric. Meticulous installation guarantees the functional integrity and optimal performance of these components. It serves as the foundational layer for a highly available and resilient IT ecosystem, where adherence to best practices ensures optimal system operation and efficient resource utilization. Move The IMACD Move phase addresses the physical and logical relocation of IT resources. This encompasses the migration of hardware assets to a new site (e.g., office relocation or reconfiguration) and the data and software transfer between servers or cloud environments. Add The \"Add\" phase of IMACD focuses on the planned integrations of new IT components into the existing infrastructure. This involves the strategic onboarding and configuration of various elements, including: \u2022 Software applications: Deployment and integration of new software tools with existing systems, ensuring compatibility and data interoperability. \u2022 Hardware upgrades: Incorporation of enhanced hardware components to augment performance, functionality, or capacity, adhering to technical specifications and compatibility standards. \u2022 Network expansions: Extension of the network infrastructure to accommodate additional devices, locations, or increased bandwidth requirements, following network design principles and security best practices. Change The configuration management workflow within IT operations hinges on controlled deployments to modify or update hardware or software configurations.

It is not about finding the root cause and fixing it with tickets. Tickets are about resuming services ASAP, which means finding workarounds, temporary fixes, etc. \u2022 Escalation & Notification - When a ticket requires additional or advanced support, support/help desk agents escalate them to the next level of support (L2/L3) or field engineers while keeping the requester and technicians informed of the proceedings. \u2022 Resolution & Recovery - Resolution being a workaround/temporary fix/software patch is applied and confirmed that the service is recovered/restored. \u2022 Ticket closure - Though the service desk technician adds a resolution and marks recovery, a ticket is considered closed only when the requester agrees on the resolution given. \u2022 Auto Closure for tickets: The system configuration will automatically close the ticket after the specified days.

A problem can be detected in two ways. \u2022 Suppose different requesters raise multiple tickets for the same issue. Then it means there is an underlying issue that needs to be further analyzed. Then a problem is recorded. \u2022 If a completely new issue arises with an unknown underlying cause, then a problem is recorded. \u2022 Problem Recording - Only a technician or users with the required permissions can log a Problem in the module. \u2022 Classification & Prioritization - It is essential to capture all the details of the problem, such as problem type and description. A problem has a category and sub-category. Capturing and classifying the details makes it easier to assign & monitor the problem. \u2022 Investigation & Diagnosis - Problem Management is about finding an issue's root cause. A detailed Root Cause Analysis(RCA) is performed based on the urgency and severity of the problem. Multiple analyses can be added until the root cause is identified. The various methods used for analysis are: \u2022 5-Whys \u2022 Chronological \u2022 Kepner Tregoe \u2022 Create a Known Error Record - In ITIL, a Known Error is \"a problem with a documented root cause and a workaround.\" It is essential to record this information into a Known Error Database (KEDB) so that if this issue or problem arises in the future, the service desk technician can quickly look into the KEDB and provide a quick resolution or associated workaround. This leads to less downtime. \u2022 Create a workaround, if necessary - A workaround is a temporary solution to a problem so that it can reduce the impact on a business. A workaround for a problem can be created and documented in the KEDB. \u2022 Escalation & Notification - A technician escalates the problem to L2/L3 level technicians or engineers when a problem requires more significant expertise. The technicians are kept well-informed of these proceedings through notification emails.",

When we click on the Problem ID, it opens the details of the problem. In the right-side panel, there is an option to add the analysis of the problem. Multiple analyses can be added until the root cause is identified. These analysis details are saved as a Draft and can be viewed/edited at any time. The various methods used for analysis are: 5 Whys Method The 5 whys method was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries. The 5 whys is an iterative analysis technique that aims to expose the underlying cause by asking the question, \"Why\" five times. The number '5' comes from the observation that usually five iterations of the question 'why' reveals the underlying root cause. How to implement the 5 whys method: \u2022 Ask why the problem took place. Write the answer to this question. \u2022 Keep asking 'why' to the successive answers and note down the answers. \u2022 Repeat the step above until you reach the root cause of the problem. This may take five or less than five 'whys'. If you feel satisfied with the analysis, click on 'Save Changes' to save the analysis. Chronological Method As the name suggests, Chronological analysis is a time-based approach. It helps take a look at the events in the order of occurrence from first to last. All the events from the time a problem occurred are recorded in a chronological manner and analyzed. Kepner Tregoe Method Kepner Tregoe method is a problem-analysis method developed by Charles Kepner and Benjamin Tregoe. It is a step-by-step approach to systematically gathering information and evaluating it. It gathers the following information in a structured way.",

Usually, a high-level manager or a Domain Expert is assigned as a Change Manager to a change request. Change Advisory Board(CAB) - A Change Advisory Board (CAB) may consist of Business, IT Operations, Development, Customer, Domain Experts, and Solution Architects, depending upon the type of the change. A CAB is carefully selected to ensure all facets of an organization are represented while discussing the impacts, benefits, and implementation of a change. CAB requires financial data, the technical advantage of the change request, the number of resources required, criticality, and so on, to make an informed decision on the change request.

A Change Manager also ensures there is coordination between different teams involved in the change implementation. \u2022 Review - Once a change is implemented, a Post Implementation Review is conducted to confirm if the change implementation was successful. A review is also performed to determine if the change achieved its objectives. If the change implementation is unsuccessful, the rollback plan is activated promptly. \u2022 Closure - This is the last step in the Change management process.

The primary objective of the event management module within ITIL is to detect all changes or activities within the infrastructure, observe for anomalies and raise the alarm, if necessary. Events are Infraon's way of active and passive monitoring of \u2022 CI items like laptops, desktops, etc., \u2022 Software licensing and performance \u2022 Application performance \u2022 Server performance Monitoring the status and availability of items are part of active monitoring, while detection and correlation of operational alerts based on the configured thresholds and triggers are passive monitoring. Infraon's Event Management module enables users/organizations to achieve their goals through the below steps: \u2022 There are constant changes in the infrastructure. Ideally, a user's login, upgrade of software/hardware, or regular maintenance are all events. However, these are not events that need to be notified or taken action upon. When there is a change in the server's performance or availability, it needs to be reported immediately. Infraon extracts the necessary data from the happenings of the infrastructure and detects 'events that need attention on occurrence. \u2022 These anomalies or changes are run through the default thresholds and categorized as basic, informational, major, or performance. Thresholds can be sorted as minor, major, or critical. Refer to the Thresholds section for details. \u2022 Anomalies and changes are categorized and reported as events. \u2022 Technicians or NOC users can use these events to perform necessary actions. Note: If triggers are configured for events, a notification is triggered either at the event's occurrence or after correlating.",

Infraon's Knowledge Base module enables users to author their articles, curate articles/guides from internal or external sources, and use, share and manage knowledge across organizations and end-users. Why Knowledge Base? Studies conducted by Forrester and Ciboodle state that: \uf095 70% of customers prefer to use a company's website to get answers to their questions rather than use phone or email. \uf095 An efficient Knowledge Base can enable customers to manage 85% of their relationship with an enterprise without interacting with a human, allowing the organizations to save. \uf095 Organizations saw a 50% increase in Customer Satisfaction ratings through social Customer Support (Public Knowledge Base). An adequate Knowledge Base empowers the end user to quickly find answers and information needed when they need them without having to go through the hassle of waiting to get hold of an agent on call/waiting for their incident to get assigned to a Techie. Having said that, to get all the advantages of a Knowledge Base, it is essential to present such complicated and detailed information in a user-friendly format, which Infraon's Knowledge Base offers. Infraon's KB is designed to add quick problem-solving tips, troubleshooting guides, answers to frequently asked questions, sharing best practices through Articles, known errors so on in a user- friendly manner. How to build an effective Knowledge Base? A study by Coleman Parkes for Amdocs states that 91%of customers would be glad to use the available online database only if it is tailored to their needs. As easy as it may seem to build a knowledge base, it is a constant 'Work in Progress.' Follow the below steps to build an effective KB.",

ITIL4 defines SLA as \"A documented agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines both the services required and the expected level of service.\" SLA is a detailed document that defines the standards of services the customer expects from the service provider. SLAs differ across services, vendors, and industries. It is an integral part of a vendor contract because it lists the services agreed upon between the parties and the quality, availability, remedies, and penalties. In Infraon, the \"SLA\" module is an SLA-capturing tool. It is not yet implemented as a full-fledged SLA Management tool. It allows the definition of SLA metrics and service details. Benefits of SLA: \u2022 Sets clear guidelines and expectations - An SLA sets clear guidelines regarding expectations and commitments. \u2022 Improved customer service - Because of the existence of SLA between two parties, the service provider monitors and measures if the terms of the service are being met. Thus the team works efficiently to achieve the deadlines. There will be a decrease in ticket response time and hence improves customer service.",

Two Essential Components of an SLA The two essential components of an SLA are Metrics and Penalties. Metrics - Metrics are the criteria for measuring services. It is an agreed-upon measurable target between the customer and the service provider. Metrics make it easier to spot SLA breaches. *Penalty - Penalty is a disciplinary measure to be followed in case the SLA is breached. The penalty could be imposed regarding monetary refunds, service credits, etc. These terms are captured in an SLA. Metric The metric tab is used to create specific conditions so that the SLA calculations start, pause, resume, and stop at the right times. To add a Metric, go to the SLA module -> Metric -> Add Metric -> Ticket. Add the following details: Label Action Description/Example Name Name of the Metric. Give a name for the Metric. Criticality Select the criticality of the Metric. Suppose there are many parameters, the system will know which metric to follow with the help of 'Criticality'. Description Description of the Metric. Start Condition Start Condition enables a user to specify the condition under which the SLA will be attached to the ticket and begin metering. Start conditions can be configured to capture the SLA starting from when the ticket was first created or when the ticket was assigned from one team to another. Suppose a ticket was assigned to team A, and the team realizes it is not in their domain and assigns it to team B. In such cases, *OLA guidelines help manage the SLA timelines.

Let's see each of these in detail. API Registration APIs or Application Programming Interfaces are added to enable data exchange between Infraon and computers/programs/applications. API integrations are possible with other third-party applications and web services supporting HTTP protocol. Infraon supports REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer that adheres to REST architectural constraints. REST serves as a bridge between the client and the server, allowing communication over HTTP. It enables servers to cache responses, resulting in improved application performance. The REST-API serves as a single point of entry into the system. Before granting access to the application's resources, it encapsulates the business logic and processes all client requests, including authorization, authentication, data sanitization, and other necessary tasks. Infraon supports the below content types: \u2022 application/json \u2022 application/x-www-form-urlencoded \u2022 txt/plain APIs use authorization to secure client requests accessing data. While integrating third-party APIs, these credentials are provided by the respective API provider. Based on the API, you can select one of the below Auth Types: \u2022 API Key - Uses a key-value pair in the API's request headers or query parameters. \u2022 Basic Auth - Uses a verified username and password with the request. \u2022 Custom Auth - Uses token-based authorization that requires CSRF URL, token, key, username, and password with the request. \u2022 No Auth - Uses when there is no authorization to request data.

The configuration tab is enabled when adding an Approval or an Operation and Technical Team. Approval Team - Used to configure. Operation and Technical Team - Used to configure auto-assignment of tickets. What is Auto Assignment? An alert is raised when a ticket lands in the service desk queue. Either a technician self-assigns it, or a team leader takes the responsibility of assigning it to the team. When there is manual intervention, tickets may be picked based on ease of resolution, making it unfair for other technicians. It is also possible that new tickets are in the queue for too long while waiting to be assigned, impacting the SLAs. Auto assignment of tickets removes manual intervention, ensuring fairness and timely assignment. Infraon offers three methods to define auto- assignment.

    "original_chunk": "Use-case - An e-commerce business where tickets are raised to know order status, delays in delivery or refund status, etc. Since these are information- based tickets and no troubleshooting is required, the time spent on each ticket is minimal. Using the Round Robin method ensures that tickets are assigned equally and orderly. Load Balancer The load Balanced method assigns tickets based on the technician's load and is recommended for businesses offering a wide range of services, where the resolution time is different for each. Using the Load Balanced method ensures that the technicians have a balanced workload while they are already working on a ticket. When a new ticket is raised, the technician with the most negligible load is auto-assigned to the technician. Tickets are assigned based on the ticket queue's SLA, priority, and criticality. Thresholds must be defined to select this method. Use-case - A technical support center for a product that offers 24/7 support where tickets are raised throughout the day. Some of these tickets may be inquiries, while others might have a long resolution. A round-robin method may not make sense here. The load balancer method checks the current load of the technician before assigning new tickets. This way, technicians are not burdened with work. Skill Based Skill Based method is used when there are multiple categories/levels of support offered by the organization\u2014recommended for organizations providing support on a global level or across a wide range of products/services. Skill-based assignment ensures that the right technician assigns the tickets by matching their skill and level. Use-case - A business that offers support or services on multiple products, regions, and time zones offering multi-lingual support. Here, tickets must be assigned based on the skill of the technician. The technician must be skilled in the language selected by the customer, know about the product chosen, etc. A skill-based allocation is best platformd for this.

ITSM, traditionally used to deliver technology solutions effectively, has now evolved into service management, which provides business values. Service management can help organizations simplify processes within other teams like HR, Administration, Finance, Legal, etc., who rely on technology. \u2022 Service Management is an essential module of Infraon that helps organizations follow ITIL or other compliance-related practices while delivering consistent care and attention. A service-driven organization aims to support strategic business objectives with the support of ITIL. \u2022 While ITIL V3 had defined 26 processes across the service lifecycle, in ITIL 4, these 26 processes have been replaced by 34 \"practices.\" The noticeable change in ITIL 4 is its definition of service as a means to co- create value by facilitating customer desired outcomes without undergoing related costs or risks. To achieve this, ITIL Service Value System (SVS) has been introduced in ITIL 4 to replace the service lifecycle from ITIL v3. In addition to this, ITIL 4 has also introduced four dimensions replacing the 4 Ps of ITILv3: o Organizations and People o Information and Technology, o Partners and Suppliers o Value Streams and Processes \u2022 Organizations looking to implement ITIL must know that ITIL defines two types of catalogues for IT Services. Why do we need two separate catalogues? What is a catalogue, and why do we need separate catalogues? A catalogue is a compilation of items available for selection by end-users to simplify their day-to-day requests. Articles from the catalogue can include: \u2022 The organization's IT services include email creation, login credentials, laptop servicing, etc. \u2022 Non-IT services like HR (Onboarding, letters, relieving), finance (Pay-slips, tax forms), admin (Access card, cupboard keys), etc. \u2022 Asset requests for active assets like keyboard, monitor, laptop, etc. \u2022 Asset requests for fixed assets like chairs, boards, pedestals, etc., \u2022 Consumables like batteries, printer cartridges, stationeries, forms, etc.",

Service Catalogue The service catalogue is the service offering part of service management. It is the backend of the services provided through the business catalog, i.e., the module where the administrator or catalogue manager defines and manages products or services. These configured items can be viewed, wish- listed, and requested by requesters (internal and external end-users). A service catalogue is created to maintain a list of components offered as services to the end-user. Components can be used as support to enable services and not as a service directly. Only authorized staff and users can access the catalogue and perform activities like view, add, modify, authorize and delete records based on the role. The administrator or catalogue manager uses a service Catalog to define & manage services, add service categories, etc. Other users can authorize and view catalogue information. Infraon's Service catalogue offers options to create and publish products or services in detail with descriptions to facilitate structured content for the self- service framework. What can you do here? Service Catalogue need not necessarily list out only the IT components. There are other teams within the organization that provide services to employees.

A business rule for an infraon product refers to a specific guideline or constraint that governs the behavior, processes, or operations within the context of that product's infrastructure. These rules are typically defined and enforced to ensure consistency, compliance, and efficient functioning of the infraon product. Types in business rule There are two types of business rules: \u2022 Load Balancer: The ticket allocation system ensures a balanced distribution between users. Automatically routing any additional tickets beyond the initial allocation to the following user until the same number of tickets per user is reached. This ensures an equitable workload distribution. For Example: User one has seven tickets, and user two has five tickets, the upcoming tickets will be automatically added to user two, as user one already has seven tickets greater than user two. \u2022 Round Robin: Despite any existing ticket imbalances, prospective tickets raised are sequentially assigned to the first user, disregarding the need for a balanced distribution among users. For Example, User One has five tickets, and User Two has three tickets; prospective tickets are automatically assigned to the user one even though user two has less number of tickets.

Escalation What is escalation? The escalation process and automatic assignment mechanism are employed in support ticket resolution. When a ticket is raised, it is initially assigned to an L1 user, if L1 cannot resolve the ticket, it is escalated to the appropriate escalation team. The escalation occurs from L1 to L2 and L3 in descending order. Automatic escalation is triggered in L1, with the system selecting a user for escalation.

Blacklist and Whitelist In the realm of software and application security, two key concepts arise: blacklisting and whitelisting. These methods, though seemingly opposite, both play crucial roles in safeguarding your system from unwanted programs and vulnerabilities. What is blacklisting? Blacklisting operates on a principle of exclusion. A blacklist is a curated list of programs deemed undesirable, malicious, or unauthorized. Software identified on the blacklist is then blocked from installation or execution on a system. Here are some common reasons why software might be blacklisted: \u2022 Known malware or viruses: These programs are designed to harm your system, steal data, or disrupt operations. \u2022 Unwanted applications: Some software might be considered disruptive or inappropriate for certain environments. \u2022 Pirated software: Using illegal copies of software can be harmful and is often blacklisted. \u2022 Vulnerable applications: Programs with known security flaws pose a risk and might be blacklisted until patched.",

A whitelist is a curated list of programs explicitly permitted to be installed or run on a system. Any software not on the whitelist is automatically restricted. Whitelisting offers several advantages: \u2022 Enhanced security: Only authorized and vetted software can run, significantly reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized access. \u2022 Simplified management: Administrators have complete control over what software is allowed, making it easier to maintain a secure environment. \u2022 Improved compliance: Whitelisting can help organizations comply with specific security regulations or internal policies.

Rules Log Rule A robust Infraon Infinity solution must monitor certain events in real-time to facilitate swift responses to security threats. Log rules are essential components that define how log data is processed, examined, and acted upon within logging and monitoring systems. Note: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions before creating or modifying alerts. Infraon's alerting system allows you to set up rules that continuously scan log data for specific conditions. When these conditions are met, the system triggers predefined alerts. In essence, rules are predetermined scenarios that, when matched, initiate an alarm, event, or configured action. Each rule consists of three key elements:",

These rules are based on specific criteria you define, such as error rate thresholds or particular log patterns. The system offers two main types of rules: Custom Query Custom query rules use tailored search parameters to identify alert-worthy conditions in your log data. To set up a custom query rule: \u2022 Formulate a query that filters the log data you want to monitor \u2022 Design the query to capture the exact conditions that should trigger an alert \u2022 Specify how often the system should run this query to check for matching log entries (e.g., every 5 minutes) Threshold Rule Activates when defined thresholds are reached. Select the metric or data point for monitoring. For instance, you could track the number of error logs or the average response time. Establish the alert triggers, such as limits for high error frequencies or unexpected data surges. \u2022 Trigger Condition: For example, if the error tally reaches over 100 in 5 minutes. \u2022 Alert Frequency: The regularity of condition assessment (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Download Jobs Download Job refers to a task that involves retrieving configuration files from network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and others and storing them centrally within the system. The download typically captures the devices' current running configuration and start-up configuration. This job helps IT teams maintain up-to-date backups for disaster recovery, ensure compliance with internal policies, and track any configuration changes over time. The management admin (user with appropriate privileges) initiates the download process, where network devices can be selected and the configuration type (running or start-up configuration) specified. The tool helps ensure that all configurations are securely backed up, enabling efficient configuration management across multiple devices and vendors.

Thresholds Infraon allows users to define health indexes for monitoring the network's performance. Thresholds play an essential role in tracking the fault and performance of devices and detecting faults and performance-based alerts. These faults and performance are indicated using severity levels as follows: \u2022 Critical: Indicated in Red \u2022 Major: Indicated in Orange \u2022 Minor: Indicated in Yellow \u2022 Informational: Indicated in Green Furthermore, there are two state-based indicators which are: \u2022 Unknown/Dependent: Indicated in Blue \u2013 when the parent/primary device is down, the dependent/Child device\u2019s status is unknown. \u2022 Under Maintenance: Indicated in Grey \u2013 When a device/node is placed under maintenance for a planned outage. Thresholds can be defined for any monitoring KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Infraon is configured with built-in thresholds (global) for all the monitoring nodes and their components. Based on these thresholds, users can quickly spot resources that require attention even before thresholds are breached.

Infraon allows the user to define the following: \u2022 Set Point \u2022 Reset Point \u2022 Set Message \u2022 Reset Message \u2022 Set Alarm Hold Time \u2022 Reset Alarm Hold Time \u2022 Severity Alarm Condition Logic For the positive polarity parameters: If the Current Value is > Set Point, the node/device gets into an alarm state and continues to be in an alarm state until the value <= Reset Point. For the negative polarity parameters: If the Current Value is < Set Point, the node/device gets into an alarm state and continues to be in an alarm state until the value >= Reset Point. In addition to the standard/global thresholds across the network, the Adaptive/Dynamic threshold or baseline helps determine the performance issue of every component within the network based on its performance benchmarks and expectations. It helps eliminate unwanted alerts, thus resulting in focused business operations. Infraon UNMS supports an ML-based algorithm for auto- baselining thresholds for various performance metrics. Thresholds are mainly for Performance metrics such as Traffic Utilization, Latency, Jitter, CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Temperature, etc., Users can define multiple thresholds with different severity levels for a single monitoring parameter. For e.g., \u25e6 CPU Utilization Thresholds can be defined as follows: \u25e6 If CPU Utilization > 50%, severity is \u2018Minor\u2019 \u25e6 If CPU Utilization > 75%, severity is \u2018Major\u2019 \u25e6 If CPU Utilization > 90%, severity is \u2018Critical\u2019",

Log Management Logging is an integral part of IT infrastructure management and process. Logs are generated from Routers, Switches, firewalls, IDS/IPS, Servers, Databases, and Web Servers across the IT infrastructure. They can be a generic live status of the end system or a detailed log of the running processes. Log Management, a part of Infraon Infinity, helps in real-time analysis that can be used for security, compliance, audit, and IT operations. Log Management enables reacting to anomalies based on log events and patterns, which play a crucial role in application troubleshooting, business analytics, marketing insights, resource management, and regulatory compliance.",

Access depends on the type of license purchased by the portal operator. Note: The administrator drafted this document after accessing all the operator/user portal modules. Administrators are responsible for adding or editing user roles and privileges to manage logs. Similar to other modules, specific roles will be configured for the Log Management module. The log management system will update These roles and permissions to ensure appropriate access control. Users can log in with the assigned credentials and perform tasks within the Log Management module based on their privileges and permissions. Access to various features within the module will depend on the Roles and Privileges the administrator enables. (Click here to view the guide on how to add or edit users with specific roles and permissions.) How does it work? Log management collects, stores, analyses, and monitors log data generated by systems, applications, and services within an IT infrastructure. This module will be taking logs of assets uploaded to our system. This module enables users to access network device logs via the Syslog server. For Windows-specific logs, utilize the Winlog beat server. To collect Linux logs, employ the file beat server. Logs will be saved in the elastic database, and log stash can be used as a pipeline to dump data into it. Log Management will fetch data from the elastic database and show it in the Infraon interface based on configuration. Monitoring, documenting, and analyzing system events are crucial components of security intelligence (SI). Regarding compliance, regulations such as PCI have specific mandates relating to audit logs. Log management software automates many of the processes involved. For example, an event log manager (ELM) tracks organizational IT infrastructure changes. These changes are reflected in audit trails that must be produced for a compliance audit. Log Management is then configured in the below sub-modules: Log Multi-Index: Create and manage the multi-indexes that help retrieve data from Elasticsearch.",

It creates a unified view of similar indices, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of log data within the system. Log indices are collections of patterns that link the log management server with the data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can define how the system interprets and displays log data by configuring index patterns. This module allows users to add, edit, or delete indices as needed. Each index name follows a structured format based on the timestamp, which helps organize logs efficiently. Example: windows-yyyy.mm.dd To retrieve logs for the last three days, users can select the relevant index patterns to create a comprehensive multi-index. Example: windows-2024.09.03, windows-2024.09.04, and windows- 2024.09.05 Users can use wildcard patterns to retrieve logs for multiple days or all related indices. Example: windows* groups all Windows-related indices. The multi-index generated will include default fields such as: \u2022 host.ip \u2022 host.id \u2022 host.name.
