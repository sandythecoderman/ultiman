# Main Plan Deviations

This document tracks the major changes and additions made to the project, deviating from the original `knowledge_base_population.md` plan. These changes were implemented to address unforeseen challenges and improve the overall quality and robustness of the data pipeline.

### 1. Addition of a Data Cleaning Step (`2a_clean_docs.py`)

*   **Deviation:** The original plan did not include a specific step for cleaning the raw text data from the user guide.
*   **Reason:** During testing, it was discovered that the source documents contained significant "noise" (e.g., copyright notices, page numbers) which was negatively impacting the quality of the vector search embeddings.
*   **Implementation:** A new script, `2a_clean_docs.py`, was created to programmatically remove these boilerplate patterns from the `enriched_user_guide.json` before the embedding generation step.

### 2. Overhaul of Knowledge Graph Construction (`4_build_knowledge_graph.py`)

*   **Deviation:** The original plan was missing a dedicated script for building the complex, hierarchical knowledge graph. The initial approach of a simple load was insufficient.
*   **Reason:** The verification report revealed that the graph was "flat" and missing the entire high-level ontology (Modules, Sub-Modules), critical relationships, and keyword aliases specified in the master plan.
*   **Implementation:** The script `4_build_knowledge_graph.py` was created from scratch. This script acts as the "brain" of the pipeline, explicitly defining the full ontology and intelligently building the graph structure before the loading step. This is the most significant architectural change.

### 3. Creation of a Deep Verification Script (`7_deep_verification.py`)

*   **Deviation:** The original plan ended with a basic loading and testing step.
*   **Reason:** Initial results showed low accuracy. A more rigorous, automated, and repeatable method was needed to test the knowledge base against the specific goals outlined in `Plan for Ultiman.md`.
*   **Implementation:** The `7_deep_verification.py` script was created. It performs a comprehensive suite of tests on the graph's schema, the vector databases' relevance, and integrated GraphRAG workflows.

### 4. Introduced Docker for Neo4j Environment

*   **Deviation:** The original plan assumed a direct local connection to a Neo4j instance.
*   **Reason:** We encountered persistent and difficult-to-resolve networking issues when connecting from a WSL environment to a Neo4j instance running on the Windows host.
*   **Implementation:** A `docker-compose.yml` file was created to run Neo4j in a containerized environment. This completely bypasses host/WSL networking problems, providing a stable, portable, and reproducible database environment for the project.
